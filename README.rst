mshr is the mesh generation component of `FEniCS
<http://fenicsproject.org/>`_. It generates simplicial `DOLFIN
<https://bitbucket.org/fenics-project/dolfin>`_ meshes in 2D and 3D
from geometries described by Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) or from
surface files, utilizing CGAL and Tetgen as mesh generation backends.

To build mshr from source, run::

  cmake <path to mshr source tree>
  make
  make install

mshr's build script will also build CGAL and Tetgen from source and
include them in the binary.

Dependencies
============

mshr needs `DOLFIN <https://bitbucket.org/fenics-project/dolfin>`_
with Python support (pyDolfin). `CGAL <http://www.cgal.org/>`_ and
`Tetgen <http://www.tetgen.org>`_ are shipped with mshr and built from
source automatically. CGAL needs `Gnu GMP <https://gmplib.org/>`_ and
`Gnu MPFR <http://www.mpfr.org/>`_.
