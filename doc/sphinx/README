====================
Sphinx documentation
====================

mshr is documented using Sphinx and reStructured text. The
documentation is hosted at http://fenics-mshr.readthedocs.org/. The
online documentation is automatically updated upon pushes to the mshr
master branch.


Building the documentation locally
==================================

The HTML documentation can be built locally using::

    make html

In order for changes in the docstring to be propagated to the html
pages, mshr must be installed anew. In other words, sphinx reads the
docstrings from the installed code, not the source code.
